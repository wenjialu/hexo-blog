What I want to do:
I need a server to depoly my applications, such as websites.
I used to depoly my websites on Github Pages, but that only works for static pages and it has many limitations.


Why I use Google Cloud:
I now there are many companies could provide server service, such as Aliyun, HuaweiCloud, AWS, etc.
Most of they only provide 30-day trail.
Google Cloud, on the other hand, not only allows me to use it for free for a year but also give me 300 $ for trial, so I choose it.

How to use it:
It is quite easy as long as you have a Visa.
1. Wisit its [website](https://cloud.google.com/). 
2. Find "VM instance" from the left sidebar and click it.
3. Fill the information of your bill.
4. Select the configuration of your server.
5.Done!
